# VIO-for-Functional-Verification-on-Xilinx-Vivado
Virtual Input/Output (VIO) in Xilinx Vivado facilitates functional verification of FPGA designs. The VIO core allows users to dynamically control and monitor signals within an FPGA design during hardware debugging and testing. This can significantly enhance the verification process by providing real-time interaction with the design. It enables real-time monitoring and modification of internal signals during simulation and hardware debugging.
